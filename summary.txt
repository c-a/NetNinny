Summary

The NetNinny proxy performs a simple text based filtering on content on the web. It searches through the url and the html content body for hard-coded inappropriate strings and redirects the user to a page informing them of the blocked content.

It can only handle HTTP GET interactions with servers and not for example HTTP POST interactions. HTTPS works on a different port than HTTP and does not get filtered. Only non-compressed text content is filtered, everything else is passed through.

The size of pages due to videos and images does not matter because the content is just passed through. Abnormally large text files could however lead to excessive swapping.
